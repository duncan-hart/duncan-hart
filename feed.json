Being brave   \nLets no one off the grave.\nDeath is no different whined at than withstood.\n\nSlowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.   \nIt stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,   \nHave always known, know that we can’t escape,   \nYet can’t accept. One side will have to go.\nMeanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring   \nIn locked-up offices, and all the uncaring\nIntricate rented world begins to rouse.\nThe sky is white as clay, with no sun.\nWork has to be done.\nPostmen like doctors go from house to house.\n\n",
